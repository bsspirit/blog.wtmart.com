According to the newest released economic data, China’s economic growth remains weak if not bad.  The only good news is that China’s official PMI rose to 50.8 in May from 50.6 in April, which beat market expectation.  CPI rose to 2.4% YOY in Apr from 2.1% in Mar, and PPI drastically fall to -2.6% YOY from -1.9% in Mar, which was much lower than the market’s expectation according to the Bloomberg consensus survey.  The money supply and new loan data remain to be very strong, whether the strong money supply and bank loans will support an economic recovery through the third quarter is still doubtable.

*   **The Manufacturing PMI rise to 50.8 in May from 50.6 in Apr,** the official purchasing managers’ index increase to 50.8 in May from 50.9 in April.  The slight pick up in May PMI gives the market a hope that the economy may stabilizes in the coming quarter.  But in our opinion, the official PMI focuses on big and state-owned firms, and the rising in data is largely caused by the recovery in production side, the demand side of the economy is still very weak.  The flash private PMI survey released by HSBC also confirms our opinion, which fell to 49.2 in May.
*   **Imports growth increase to 16.8% YOY in Apr****, **under the current weak demand condition, import growth seems to be “surprisingly strong” for the market, there are a lot of economists believe that import growth may have been affected by fake invoices as companies circumvented capital controls to move funds into China.  In our opinion, if the US economy continues to recover, the opportunities for the arbitrageurs will become small and we expect that the import growth data will drop significantly in the next several months.
*   **Industrial Production increase to 9.3% YOY in Apr from 8.9% in Mar, **industry production rose 9.3 percent YOY in Apr, up from 8.9% in Mar.  Although the industrial output growth quickened to 9.3% in April, it still lower than the market’s expectation.  In our opinion, we have seen little evidence that the fundamentals are improving and the China’s economic recovery was still uncertain.
*   **Money supply and new loan remain strong:** M1 and M2 grow 11.9% and 16.1% YOY respectively and new credit in Mar is 792 billion. The money supply and new loan data remain to be very strong, but the economy continues to be weak.  As we said in the last month, we think that the reason why growth doesn’t match the money supply and new loan is mainly due to the fact that part of the new loan is used to pay the old debt and the other reason, the level of efficiency in the economy has declined since excess production in some industries make investment unprofitable.  In our opinion, this situation is very likely to continue until the structure reform in China’s economy finishes.
